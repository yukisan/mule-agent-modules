= Event Tracker DB Internal Handler

The DB Internal handler will store all the Event Notifications produced from the
Mule ESB flows in a configurable database.
You have to copy your JDBC .jar driver to the ${MULE_HOME}/plugins/mule-agent-plugin/lib/modules,
so the mule agent can load it to the classpath.
